# Design patterns implemented in Java

Catalog of popular object-oriented design patterns in Java

## Creational

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base.

 - [Singleton](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/singleton)
 - [Builder](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/builder)
 - [Factory Method](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/factory)
 - [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/abstractfactory)
 - [Prototype](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/prototype)
 
## Structural

Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realise relationships between entities or defines a manner for creating relationships between objects.

 - [Bridge](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/bridge)
 - [Composite](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/composite)
 - [Decorator](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/decorator)
 - [Proxy](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/proxy)
 - [Adapter](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/adapter)
 
## Behavioral

Behavioral pattern explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects.

 - [Iterator](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/iterator)
 - [Observer](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/observer)
 - [State](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/state)
 - [Strategy](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/strategy)
 - [Template Method](https://github.com/Jayash/java-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/template)
 
 The SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design include these five principles:
 
 - S – Single Responsibility Principle. A Class should have a single responsibility.
 - O – Open/Closed Principle. Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 - L – Liskov Substitution Principle. Objects in a program should be replaceable by subclasses of same type without any adverse impact.
 - I – Interface Segregation Principle. Multiple client specific interfaces are preferable over single generic interface.
 - D – Dependency Inversion Principle. Program should depend on abstract entities. It should not depend on concrete implementation of an interface.
